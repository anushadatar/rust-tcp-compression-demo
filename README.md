## Build and Test
### Target Platform

Ubuntu 17.04) and language, if applicable (e.g. C++14 compiled

## Architecture
– A brief description of the inner workings of your code
## Design Decisions
### Assumptions
– A description of any assumptions that you made while implementing

## Resources
– A list of third party libraries or other projects which you used along
with a very short description of why you used that particular library
- As I'm still fairly new to Rust, I referenced [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/index.html) to gain context and solve problems.

## Future Improvements
– Optionally, a description of any improvements that you would make
to your code if given more time or resources
